# Switchblade

# To Use #
There is the C2 and the controller files. The C2 uses Flask to handle beacon requests and then the controller uses gRPC to talk with the Flask server and get updates on command status as well as write new commands

# To Run #

Put the C2 and controller in the same folder. Start the C2 and wait for a beacon to check in. Once a beacon checks in, you can use the controller to send new commands to it as well as get the status on executed commands


# To Generate PB # 

```
python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=. ./protobuff.proto --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=.
```
